Chronic diseases are an important public health problem, which can result in morbidity, mortality, disability, and decreased quality of life. 
Chronic diseases represented seven of the top 10 causes of death in the United States in 2010.  
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. More than 600,000 Americans die of heart disease each year. 
That’s one in every four deaths in this country. The term “heart disease” refers to several types of heart conditions. 
The most common type is coronary artery disease, which can cause heart attack. 
Other kinds of heart disease may involve the valves in the heart, or the heart may not pump well and cause heart failure. 
Objective of this study is to see how tableau software can compare both the datasets and answer questions by dashboards.
This dashboard introduces data visualization conceptual bases and propose a visual analytic and visualization platform in chronic disease surveillance for federal, state, and local public health to make more appropriate decisions. 
The reason for measuring the overall quality of data is to improve it and perform benchmark analysis to get a clear understanding of the quality of the dataset.
